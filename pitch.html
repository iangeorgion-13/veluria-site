  <h1>VELURIA</h1>
  <p>
  Veluria is a premium digital infrastructure built for the next generation of independent creators. 
  It is not a marketplace, it is a technology layer that empowers creators to own their audience, 
  control their revenue and protect their content while delivering a cinematic, private and trusted experience for fans worldwide.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h1>The Problem</h1>
  <p>
  Today’s creator platforms extract up to 30% of all revenue, enforce opaque algorithms, 
  restrict creator freedom and expose content to piracy, chargebacks and account shutdowns. 
  Fans face data tracking, low-quality platforms and unstable access. 
  Both sides lose trust in the system.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h1>The Solution</h1>
  <p>
  Veluria offers a fully integrated platform where creators keep 85% of their income, 
  own their audience and distribute content through protected, tokenized and watermark-secured streams. 
  Fans get privacy-first access, no ads, no tracking and cinematic quality.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h1>Why Now</h1>
  <p>
  The global creator economy is projected to exceed hundreds of billions of dollars, 
  while privacy regulations, payment instability and platform risk are accelerating. 
  Creators are actively searching for premium, independent and compliant platforms. 
  Veluria is positioned exactly at that inflection point.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h1>Revenue Model</h1>
  <p>
  Veluria takes a transparent 15% platform fee across subscriptions, pay-per-view and digital goods. 
  Payments are processed through cards and cryptocurrency with global payouts. 
  This creates scalable recurring revenue with low marginal costs.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h1>Technology</h1>
  <p>
  Veluria is built with a secure multi-layered architecture including antifraud, device fingerprinting, 
  IP intelligence, KYC, anti-piracy watermarking, protected streaming tokens and a fully modular backend. 
  The platform is designed to scale globally with regulatory compliance.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h1>Vision</h1>
  <p>
  Veluria is building the financial and technological backbone of the premium creator economy. 
  Our vision is to become the Stripe and Netflix combined for independent creators, powering millions 
  of businesses around the world.

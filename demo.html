  <h1>VELURIA</h1>
  <p>
  Veluria is a premium digital infrastructure designed to power the next generation of independent creators.
  It combines payments, content delivery, security and audience ownership into one unified platform.
  Unlike traditional marketplaces, Veluria does not control creators — it empowers them.

<div class="slide">
  <h1>Market Opportunity</h1>
  <p>
  The global creator economy is valued at hundreds of billions of dollars and continues to grow exponentially.
  Millions of creators are migrating away from platforms that extract high fees, restrict content and expose them to financial and platform risk.
  Veluria is positioned to become the premium backbone for this entire market.
